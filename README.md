# PrimeNumberFluctuationStationarity
Prime Number Fluctuation Stationarity Project  A novel approach to the Riemann Hypothesis via analyzing prime counting function fluctuations. We define a weighted mean square error functional, construct a testable intermediate conjecture, and establish its equivalence with the Riemann Hypothesis.
